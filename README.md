#iCloudECG Server-Side System

This is an Apache-Tomcat Java servlet application used for ECG record collection from the iCloudECG mobile app. The system receives record data information from the application and analyzes the data for various heart abnormalities. Feedback is provided to the user, physician, or designated recipient via Google Cloud messages (push notifications) or via email, if desired. The web-application allows a user to login and view record charts and analysis results, and to manage their record collection.
